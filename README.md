Home Assistant HACS integration for **Hughes Power Watchdog** surge protectors and power management devices.

> **Disclaimer:** This is an independent community integration and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Hughes or any of its affiliates. Use it at your own risk.

Connects directly to the device over Bluetooth Low Energy — there is no cloud or internet dependency.

> Power Watchdog EPO devices can only connect to one bluetooth device at a time. If you have issues, ensure there is not another app trying to connect to the EPO.

| Signal Strength | Sensor (diag) | signal_strength | dBm | Updated on reconnect only — see note |

> **Signal Strength (RSSI) note:** The PMD stops advertising once a GATT connection is established — standard BLE behavior. The Signal Strength sensor therefore captures the RSSI seen during the most recent connection attempt rather than updating continuously during a session. It refreshes on every reconnect, making it useful for comparing signal quality when moving to a new location or diagnosing range-related instability. As a guide: -55 dBm or better is excellent; -75 dBm is marginal; -80 dBm or below may contribute to connection instability.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.1+ with Bluetooth integration
- Bluetooth adapter on the HA host (or ESPHome BT proxy)
- Hughes Power Watchdog device within BLE range

## Installation (HACS)

1. Add this repository as a custom HACS repository
2. Install "Hughes Power Watchdog"
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. The device should auto-discover — or add manually via Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Hughes Power Watchdog and enter the Bluetooth MAC address

## Startup Delay

When Home Assistant restarts, all BLE integrations attempt to connect simultaneously, which can exhaust the Bluetooth adapter's connection slots and cause failures. This integration uses a MAC-derived startup delay to stagger its connection attempt relative to other BLE integrations.

The delay is calculated from the last octet of the device's MAC address:

```
delay = (last MAC octet) / 20.0   →   range: 0–12.75 seconds
```

For example, a device with MAC `40:79:12:B6:33:9B` has last octet `0x9B` = 155, giving a startup delay of `155 / 20 = 7.75s`.

The delay is deterministic — the same device always gets the same delay — and requires no user configuration.

**To adjust the spread**, edit `__init__.py` and change the divisor:

```python
startup_delay = mac_offset / 20.0   # default: 0–12.75s spread
```

| Divisor | Max delay | When to use |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `10.0` | 25.5s | Many co-located BLE integrations |
| `20.0` | 12.75s | Default — good for up to 5 devices |
| `40.0` | 6.4s | Fast adapter, few integrations |

To disable the delay entirely, set `startup_delay = 0.0`.

## Protocol

### Gen1 (PMD\*, PWS\* name prefix)

- **Service**: `0000FFE0-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`
- **Notify** (`FFE2`): 20-byte chunks assembled in pairs into 40-byte frames
- **Notify** (`FFF5`): command response channel, enabled on connect
- Big-endian int32 values ÷ 10000 for electrical measurements
- No authentication or pairing required
- **Chunk resync**: a dropped or reordered BLE notification (most often right after a reconnect) can leave the 20-byte chunk pairing off by one, silently producing frames with garbage in the second-chunk fields (frequency, L1/L2 line marker) while the first-chunk fields (voltage/current/power/energy) still look plausible. `Gen1FrameAssembler` detects this — an incoming chunk that itself starts with the frame header while a chunk is already pending means the true second chunk never arrived — and resyncs immediately instead of mispairing. As a backstop, frames with an out-of-range frequency (outside 45–65 Hz) are rejected outright rather than reaching Home Assistant.

### Gen2 (WD\_\* name prefix)

- **Service**: `000000FF-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`
- **Read/Write/Notify** (`FF01`): Binary framed packets with magic header `0x247C2740`
- ASCII handshake (`!%!%,protocol,open,` → `ok`) enters binary mode
- `DLReport` (0x01) carries 34-byte (single) or 68-byte (dual-line) measurement body
- No authentication or pairing required

## Troubleshooting

### BLE connection instability

- Ensure no other app (e.g. the Hughes mobile app) has the device paired or connected — Power Watchdog EPO devices support only one BLE connection at a time.
- If running multiple BLE integrations (EasyTouch, OneControl, etc.) on a single adapter, consider adding an [ESPHome Bluetooth proxy](https://esphome.github.io/bluetooth-proxies/) near the Power Watchdog to give it a dedicated connection path.
- Check that the device is within reliable BLE range. RSSI below -80 dBm indicates marginal range and may cause intermittent drops.

### Device drops connection under heavy load

- Hughes Power Watchdog devices may reset their BLE radio when the surge protector trips or responds to voltage events (overvoltage, undervoltage, overcurrent).
- On 50A (dual-line) installations with long shore power cables, voltage sag under heavy load (AC compressor starts, etc.) can trigger protection events that reset the BLE stack. This is normal device behavior.

### Both L1 and L2 not appearing

- L2 entities are created automatically when the first L2 telemetry frame is received. On first installation, wait up to 60 seconds after initial connection for L2 data to appear.
- Confirm dual-line operation in the logs: `Gen1 data from <addr>: L2 <V> / <A> / error=OK`

### L2 Frequency (or other L2 values) spike to impossible numbers / graphs look erratic

- This is a known Gen1 dual-line issue: a BLE notification dropped or reordered during a reconnect could desync the 20-byte chunk pairing, producing frames with garbage frequency/line-marker data that still passed the (too-weak) frame header check. It typically showed up as `L2 Frequency` reading tens of thousands of Hz, and could also cause `L2 Energy` (and any `Total Energy` derived from it) to appear non-monotonic, triggering `total_increasing` warnings in the HA logs.
- Fixed by adding chunk-pairing resync detection plus a frequency plausibility check (see **Chunk resync** under Protocol above) — update to the latest version if you're still seeing this.
- Historical corrupted data recorded before updating is cosmetic only (it lives in the History graph for that period) and does not need manual cleanup unless those entities feed your Energy Dashboard, in which case check for a phantom consumption spike on the affected date and use Home Assistant's statistics "Adjust sum" tool to correct it.
